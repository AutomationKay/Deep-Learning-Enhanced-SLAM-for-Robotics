# Deep-Learning-Enhanced-SLAM-for-Robotics

## 1. Abstract
This project aims to develop a deep learning-enhanced Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) system on a Raspberry Pi-powered robot. The robot, equipped with a camera module, will autonomously navigate an office environment and generate an interactive 3D map. A custom lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) will be developed for real-time feature extraction to enhance traditional SLAM algorithms. The final deliverable will include an interactive 3D visualization of the mapped environment, showcasing the system's performance and potential applications.

Integrate CNN outputs to improve the occupancy grid or point cloud generation.

4.5 Visualization
Tool Selection: Use Open3D for interactive 3D visualization.
Implementation:
Convert SLAM outputs (e.g., point clouds, occupancy grids) to Open3D-compatible formats.
Create an interactive display showing the robot’s path, key features, and generated map in real time.

## 5. Expected Outcomes
Enhanced Mapping Accuracy: Improved feature extraction leads to a more accurate and robust map.
Real-Time Operation: The system should run in real time on the Raspberry Pi, demonstrating feasibility for resource-limited environments.
